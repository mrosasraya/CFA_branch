## Description <a name='desc'></a>
Bushfires are a natural phenomenon in Australia, particularly in its south-eastern region which supports densely wooded forests (Lunt et al., 2010). With changes to global climatic conditions, there is an urgent need to address the increasingly destructive nature of bushfires that occur in south-east Victoria (IPCC, 2019). During the recent Black Summer events of 2020 thousands of fire-fighters risked their lives to try and control the bushfires that spread over roughly 19 million hectares of Australia's mainland, destroyed over 3,000 homes, killed 33 people, and roughly 1 billion animals (Filkov et al. 2020). Fire crews from across Australia, as well as army, navy, and air force personnel, were called in to help stop the fires. Additional support came from the United States, Canada, and New Zealand when Australia’s fire resources became exhausted. As such, the location of Country Fire Authority (CFA) fire stations with sufficient fire safety equipment is a matter of extreme importance. A need for potentially new fire stations that are positioned strategically to minimize commute time to fire-affected areas has also become more apparent.

The shire of Wellington, located to the west of Gippsland and south of Alpine and Mansfield shires in Victoria, is the chosen municipal area to address these concerns. Many of the existing fire stations in Wellington shire are unevenly distributed. This is largely due to a lack of road networks, inaccessibility, and extreme climatic conditions of the Victorian High Country, which is situated in the most northerly area of the shire. The main motivation for the present project is to identify potential areas for new fire stations in the municipality of Wellington shire.

The definition of bushfire fighting, as stated by Australia’s Department of Agriculture Water and Environment in its procedures of bushfire management and national environment law, is to prevent bushfires from damaging the environment, life, or property (Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment, n.d.). Typically, in bushfire prone areas the mobility is more limited than in urban areas, the topography is diverse, and, most importantly, the preservation of the environment is key.

## Proposal <a name='main'></a>

The approach used in this study corresponds to a location-based deterministic model informed by static variables that do not vary over time or from one incident to another. Location modeling approaches maximise the response time given to a defined demand of population centers and the supply of facilities. As such, the model’s final output is a raster map built with the variations of an index of service coverage. This index will be expressed as a raster value product of a mathematical integration of the data at hand.

## Data <a name='prep'></a>

The present project uses different layers of data made available by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) (Table 2). DELWP datasets include Vicmap Features of Interest (Country Fire Authority Fire stations), Vicmap Vegetation
(tree density), bushfire prone areas (BPA), historical records of fire, elevation, and road networks (as part of Vicmap Transport).
